# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Phil
**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Session Overview

**Topic:** PWA-based daily journaling application with guided sequential entry experience and clean, modern minimalist aesthetic (Notion-inspired)

**Goals:** Create a fun, fast, aesthetically distinctive tool that makes daily reflection an effortless habit - sub-5-minute guided writing experience with sequential flow through four sections (professional, personal, learning, gratitude), historical viewing, and Supabase backend

### Context Guidance

This brainstorming session focuses on software and product development considerations including:
- User Problems and Pain Points - Making daily journaling easy and habitual
- Feature Ideas and Capabilities - Guided sequential flow, visualization, history
- Technical Approaches - PWA architecture with Supabase backend
- User Experience - Simple, modern, minimalist aesthetic with warm tones (Notion-inspired), sub-5-minute experience
- Business Model and Value - Personal productivity and reflection tool
- Market Differentiation - Approachable design and guided experience with AI intelligence
- Technical Risks and Challenges - PWA implementation, engagement features
- Success Metrics - Daily usage, completion rates, user satisfaction

### Session Setup

Phil wants to create a replacement for Journey (a paid journaling app) that supports his specific morning routine. The app should guide users through four sequential sections: professional recap, personal recap, learning reflections, and gratitude. Key technical context includes leveraging Supabase (from previous Vibecoded project experience) and implementing a PWA with a simple, modern, minimalist aesthetic featuring warm tones (Notion-inspired). The focus is on making the journaling experience fun, easy, and habitual while keeping the daily entry under 5 minutes.

## Brainstorming Session - Rapid SCAMPER Sprint

**Technique Used:** SCAMPER Method (5-minute rapid-fire)
**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Ideas Generated:** 15+ feature concepts

### Ideas by SCAMPER Category

#### **S - SUBSTITUTE** (Replace existing elements)
1. **Guided question prompts replace blank page** - Eliminate blank page anxiety by starting with pre-populated questions that guide the user through each section
2. **Question-driven coach flow** - Transform each section into a coaching question: "What did you do yesterday professionally?" "What did you do yesterday with your personal time?" "What did you learn?" "What is your gratitude?"

#### **C - COMBINE** (Merge elements together)
3. **Yesterday's entry shown while writing today** - Display previous day's content alongside current entry (toggleable to avoid influence bias) - creates continuity and reflection opportunity

#### **A - ADAPT** (Borrow from other domains)
4. **Duolingo-style streaks** - Daily completion streaks to build habit reinforcement and motivate consistency
5. **Pattern matching & similar past entries** - Show when today's writing is similar to something written in the past - reveals recurring themes and life patterns, demonstrates personal growth

#### **M - MODIFY** (Change or enhance existing features)
6. **AI analysis & feedback on entries** - App reads entries and provides encouragement, identifies patterns, offers advice - transforms one-way diary into conversational coach experience

#### **P - PUT TO OTHER USES** (Repurpose data/features)
7. **"On This Day" memories** - Show journal entries from 1-2 years ago on the same date - nostalgia trigger and growth visualization
8. **Brain dump space** - Separate unstructured area outside the routine journal for evacuating random ideas, negative thoughts, positive thoughts - available anytime for mental decluttering

#### **E - ELIMINATE** (Simplify and remove)
9. **Write-first UX** - Open app → immediately start writing (if no entry today exists) - navigation only appears after completion
10. **Eliminate navigation clutter** - Primary action is always "Add entry", everything else is secondary
11. **Simple vertical timeline scroll** - Browse past entries with simple up/down scrolling, no complex calendar views or navigation

#### **R - REVERSE** (Flip or do opposite)
12. **Show yesterday's entry BEFORE starting today** - Reverse the blank slate approach by displaying yesterday's content first, then begin today's entry - creates context and continuity
